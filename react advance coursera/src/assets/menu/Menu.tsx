// # Compound Components Quiz

// 1. How would you explain the concept of compound components in React to someone who
//    only knows the very basics of React?
// making a set of components work together for keeping code clean and modular. Allows different parts of the component to be defined seperately but used together in a coordinated fashion. Like a sandwich:
// Bread - main wrapper / component that holds eberything together
//ingredients - child components that go inside parent / wrapper


// 2. What are some examples of HTML elements that work together to add functionality
//    or styling to each other?
// menus, inputs, ordered / unordered lits


// 3. How can compound components help you avoid having to drill props multiple levels
//    down?
// compounding component places all components being used on one page, destroying potential multiple levels of code that would create prop drilling
